    /// * To create a bulleted list, precede each of the listâ€™s items with an asterisk (*) and a space. Alternatively, use a dash (-) or a plus sign (+) instead of an asterisk (*); the list markers are interchangeable.
    /// * Ice
    /// - Fire
    /// * Wind

    ///1. To create a numbered list, precede each of the listâ€™s items with the number of the step, then a period (.) and a space.
    ///1. Give the sloth some food.
    ///2. Take the sloth for a walk.
    ///3. Read the sloth a story.
    ///4. Put the sloth to bed.
    ///
    /// - To create a term list, precede each term with a dash (-) and a space, the term keyword, and another space. Then add a colon (:), a space, and the definition after the term.
    /// - term Ice: Ice sloths thrive below freezing temperatures.
    /// - term Fire: Fire sloths thrive at boiling temperatures.
    /// - term Wind: Wind sloths thrive at soaring altitudes.
    /// - term Lightning: Lightning sloths thrive in stormy climates.
